# Dockerfiles

A collection of `Dockerfile`s that I'm using to learn how to use Docker.


## Notes

`docker logs` shows the output that is written to stdout by the container's foreground process.  It's not really looking
at log files per se.

`docker inspect` shows lots of useful information about the container and how it is mapped onto the host filesystem.
